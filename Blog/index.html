        <p>Gary Leonard Oldman(born 21 March 1958)is an English actor who has worked in theatre, film and television. Known for his versatility and expressive "big" acting style, Oldman is regarded as one of the greatest screen actors of his generation. Among other accolades, he has won an Academy Award, three BAFTA Awards, two Critics' Choice Awards, a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award, along with nominations for an Emmy Award and the Palme d'Or for his work both in front of and behind the camera.

Oldman began acting on stage in 1979, and gained his first starring film role in Meantime (1983). He continued to lead a successful theatre career, during which he performed at London's Royal Court and was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, with credits including The Massacre at Paris (1980), Entertaining Mr Sloane (1983), Saved (1983), The Country Wife (1987) and Hamlet (1987). Oldman's portrayals of Sid Vicious and Joe Orton, in the films Sid and Nancy (1986) and Prick Up Your Ears (1987), respectively, prompted critic Roger Ebert to describe him as "the best young British actor around".</p>
